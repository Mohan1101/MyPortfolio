My Portfolio Website!

Hello folks! Hope everyone is equipping themselves with high-tech skills meanwhile, I am excited to unveil my dynamic portfolio website, a result of my expertise in web development. Leveraging the power of the MERN stack - MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, I've created a fully functional platform. Along the journey, I encountered challenges in integration and hosting, but they served as valuable learning experiences. Utilizing Firebase for frontend hosting and Vercel for the backend, I've built a robust contact form that seamlessly sends user inputs to a MongoDB database. Fetching data with Axios enhances user interaction. This marks just the beginning of my journey with full-stack technology stacks. Explore my portfolio: https://my-profolio-4161.web.app/
